    "description": "The dumbbell chest fly is a popular exercise that targets the pectoral or chest muscles. It attempts to isolate the chest muscles, stretching and contracting them while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Unlike a press, where the elbows bend and flex, flyes should keep a relatively consistent elbow angle. The motion is sometimes compared to \"hugging a tree.\" Dumbbell flyes are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.",
    "benefits": "Works the chest muscles differently than presses\nGreat accessory movement on chest day\nEffective chest training even with relatively light weight",

    "description": "The machine seated row is a popular exercise targeting the back muscles, particularly the lats (latissimus dorsi), rhomboids, and middle and lower trapezius. There is a wide variety of seated row machines, but most of them approximate the motion of a free-weight row, but in an upright, forward-facing position. Machine row variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or back-focused portion of a workout.",
    "benefits": "Builds size and strength in the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, middle and lower traps, and biceps\nCan go heavier than most free-weight row variations\nMachines often have different grip options to choose from\nEasy to change weight for dropsets"
