  "description": "The dumbbell chest fly is a popular exercise that targets the pectoral or chest muscles. It attempts to isolate the chest muscles, stretching and contracting them while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Unlike a press, where the elbows bend and flex, flyes should keep a relatively consistent elbow angle. The motion is sometimes compared to \"hugging a tree.\" Dumbbell flyes are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.",
  "benefits": "Works the chest muscles differently than presses\nGreat accessory movement on chest day\nEffective chest training even with relatively light weight",

  "description": "The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.",
  "benefits": "Strengthens and develops the front (anterior) deltoids\nGreat burnout movement on shoulder day\nCan be performed seated or standing",

There are many ways to perform this movement (strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent) each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps.",

  "description": "The step-up with knee raise is a lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.",

  "description": "The straight-arm rope pull-down is a variation of the straight-arm lat pull-down performed using a cable stack machine and a rope grip. It can either be performed in an athletic upright stance, or slightly bent over. It both stretches and contracts the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) as well as providing additional activation to the other upper back muscles and the core. Because the triceps are also isometrically involved in the movement, it is usually performed for higher reps, such as 8-15 reps or more.",
  "benefits": "Allows lifters to \"feel\" the lats working and focus on the lower and middle part of the muscles\nGreater range of motion than the straight-arm bar pull-down\nEffective alternative to pull-overs, especially for people with limited overhead shoulder mobility",

  "description": "The single-arm cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Working the chest one side at a time allows you to focus on the balance between the sides of your chest and really feel the chest muscles contracting. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.",
  "benefits": "Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction\nCan quickly switch weights for dropsets\nStretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain",
